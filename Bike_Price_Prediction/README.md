# Bike Price Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict bike prices based on various features. The project explores data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building using multiple algorithms.

### Project Structure
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and processed using various techniques such as scaling and transformation.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of the dataset to understand the relationships between different features.
3. **Model Training**: Multiple models are trained, and their performance is evaluated using various metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, and recall.
4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated with accuracy metrics and further fine-tuned for better results.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - statsmodels
  - scipy


### Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook file `AI_PROJECT.ipynb` and run through each cell to preprocess the data, visualize key insights, and build machine learning models for bike price prediction.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of various features related to bike specifications, such as:
- Engine power
- Mileage
- Brand
- Age of the bike
- ...and more.

Ensure that you load the dataset into the notebook and follow the data preprocessing steps as specified.

### Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix

### Future Work

Future improvements can include:
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
- Testing additional machine learning algorithms
- Expanding the dataset for more robust predictions
