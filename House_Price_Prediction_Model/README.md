# House Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project is a **House Price Prediction Model** built using machine learning techniques. It aims to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features such as square footage, number of rooms, location, and other relevant factors. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical housing prices and their corresponding attributes.

## Features

- Predicts house prices based on multiple input features.
- Trained using a dataset of historical house prices.
- Utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Model evaluation using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R-squared** score.
- Includes data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.

## Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: Indicates how well the model fits the data.
